# Object-Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses Objects to design applications. In contrast, in Procedure-oriented programming programs are designed as blocks of statements to manipulate data. OOP combines data and functionality inside an entity called an "Object".

This lesson will introduce some of the basic concepts of object-oriented programming.

## Objects: 
Objects represent a real-world entity and the basic building block of OOP. 
e.g., In a Parking Lot System we will have objects such as Admin, Customer, Vehicle, Parking Attendant, System etc.
We'll look at different use-cases separately in different lessons.

## Class: 
Class is the prototype/blueprint of an Object. It is a template definition of methods and attributes of an object. 
e.g., In Parking Lot System, the Vehicle object will have attributes like Licence number, vehicle type, etc., and methods for assigning ticket, parking, etc.


## Four principles of object-oriented programming:

### Encapsulation: 
Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components. It is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them. Publicly accessible methods are generally provided in the class (getters/setters) to access the values, and other client classes call these methods to retrieve and modify the values within the object.

### Abstraction: 
TODO

### Inheritance: 
TODO

### Polymorphism: 
TODO
