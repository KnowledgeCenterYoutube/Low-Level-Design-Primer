# Low-Level-Design-Primer
Low Level Design(LLD) or Object Oriented Design(OOD) for Coding Interviews.

## Why Low Level Design(LLD)?
Low-level Design is an important part of the software engineering interviews. Many candidates struggle in LLD interviews - owing to lack of experience and indeterminate nature of LLD interviews. These are quite open-ended in nature and lack any standard answers unlike Data Structures and Algorithms interviews. The goal of this repository is to provide fundamentals of Object-Oriented Design, and provide some case studies demonstrating how to approach low-level design interviews.
